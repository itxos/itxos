I help Managed Security Providers and vCISOs turn fragmented cyber signals into strategic advantage.
Whether you’re defending OT assets, securing industrial networks, or automating compliance, I design CTI workflows that just work — fast, scalable, and secure.
🚀 Let’s build your competitive edge with better data.

## 🔎 Our Mission

Turn raw threat data into decisive action — for the defenders of critical industry.
At ITXOS, we build custom cyber threat intelligence pipelines and cloud-first detection platforms for those responsible for securing manufacturing at scale.
The mission? Faster decisions. Fewer breaches. Zero noise.

## 💼 What We Build for CTI Ops

Tailored cyber data infrastructure built with real-world defense in mind.

✅ Threat Signal Engineering – Clean, normalize, and enrich indicators from logs, sensors, and endpoints

✅ Cloud-native CTI Pipelines – Scalable collection and automation using AWS, Azure & hybrid stacks

✅ Manufacturing-Aware Dashboards – Real-time OT/IT visibility with zero clutter

✅ SOC-Ready Integrations – Detection rules, playbooks, and alerting flows built to plug in fast

✅ Risk-Aware Scoring Models – Prioritize the vulnerabilities that matter

✅ Compliance Intelligence – Auto-map findings to frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and CMMC


## 🔬 Featured Labs & Projects

Where ideas become field-tested CTI solutions for defenders in manufacturing:

🛡️ SOC Automation for OT – Python + ELK stack for autonomous log detection in mixed IT/OT environments

🌐 Simulated Cloud Attacks Lab – Threat modeling in AWS & Azure with policy enforcement

🧠 Industrial Risk Scoring Engine – Map threats to asset-criticality across production lines

🧠 GRC Risk Lab – Cyber risk scoring model for compliance-driven industries.<br>
